  The black dots are particles that move randomly around the box.  Initially, all of the particles start in the left side of the box (which is colored green).  The graph shows the number of particles in the green section and the purple section as they move.  Note that the particles don't interfere with each other at all, and so you can have multiple particles in one location.
  <ul>
    <li>As the simulation runs, notice how the number of particles on both sides evens out to the average.  This is called <emph>diffusion</emph>, and is due purely to mathematical statistics rather than to any force.
    <li>You should also notice that while the number of particles on both sides is roughly the same, it fluctuates a bit.
    <li>Make a note of the time it takes for the two curves to intersect, and the size of the fluctuations after that.  Then see how that changes as you change
      <ul>
        <li>the number of particles (typically more particles means smaller fluctuations)
        <li>the width of the box (it takes longer for particles to move from one end of the box to the other)
        <li>the height of the box
