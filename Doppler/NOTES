There are cntmax counts between every wavefront.  Each count takes time dt.

Thus the period of the wave is T = dt*cntmax.
The radius of the circle is r = vw * t.  Thus in time T, the edge travels a disance vw * T; this is the wavelength.

in the current case, lambda = 15.  That means the canvas is 511px wide.
So there should be 34 wavefronts, which is about right, sure.

I want the ears to be an integer number of wavelengths away, but within 1 wavelength of the edge.

So the distance across in wavelengths is W/2/lambda.
Let's reduce it to an integer: Math.floor(W/lambda)
subtract one, then multiple by lambda
