UI should contain
* DONE a canvas with a grid underneath
* DONE A text box which shows potential (rounded to the nearest tenth maybe), and the position x,y on the grid (optional?)
* DONE A button that starts a new line (maybe with a textbox that lets you label it)
* DONE A set of charges (filled in circles with labels underneath)

Moving the mouse = updating the textbox
Clicking on grid = draw a line from the previous point to this point (or extend the path rather)

# Things to do:
* DONE Make canvas with grid
* DONE Function to place charges at x,y with label q
* DONE Function to track mouse
** Start by showing x
** Have it show potential (rounded to nearest tenth)
* DONE Click mouse to link point to previous point
** DONE Leave points when clicked
** DONE Add the line joining
   Not as a whole path, just individual paths so they can be deleted
   Store the lines in an array associated with the current label
** DONE New line button
** DONE Click on a line to delete it
** DONE Click on a point to delete it (will need to delete lines connected to, hmm)
   This might be optional?
* Alternative idea: fill in the label automatically? Sure, why not. 
  Problem: if points done out of order, the lines will be connected incorrectly
  I need an algorithm that connects lines properly
  Might be tricky if there are multiple lines with the same label? Like two positive charges. Maybe add restrictions.
* DONE Labels
  Find the line on that potential which is longest, put label in the middle
  If potential box is empty, fill in current potential when a point is placed
  When New Line is pressed, empty the potential box
* TODO Delete curve
  Hold down Shift-X when hovering over a curve to delete entire curve
* DONE Better instructions
* TODO Switch between different charge configurations
  Easy way out: different pages
* TODO Figure out what charge configurations I *want*
* Readjust grid to the size of the window
* TODO Undo button
