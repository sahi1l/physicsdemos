Equation Game

Choose a set of eight letter variables (capital letters), four inner and four outer, arranged in circles.
Construct four equations, each with one outer and two inner.  Either sums or products.  Each equation has its own color. 
Assume the first outer is given. Choose three other variables to be given according to difficulty.  Choose target value.  Known variables are in bold?
DIsplay the four equations on buttons, and the four givens.
Drag an equation down to the "playing board" to start with it.  (Must contain the target value.)
Drag another equation on top of it, and if the equation is of the form X=f(_,_) and X is in the first equation (on the right side?), then that equation is replaced.  If not, it is rejected.  
Click on an equation to swap which variable it depends on.  Only equations up top, not on the playing board.
When the final equation contains the target value and only known quantities, then you win!

Working equation must be stored as display (with boldfaced etc) and encoded (just the letters, so they can be searched for).  Maybe in the code, all parentheses can be grouping [(->\(] and fractions are replaced with รท.  Then the variables can be lowercase as well.
