<h1>Momentum</h1>
<div style="background-color:lightcyan" id="canvas"></div>
<p><B>Goal: choose the velocity of the red ball so that, when it collides with the blue ball, the two come to a stop. Do this two times to complete successfully.</B></p>
<p>There are only internal forces when the two balls collide, so their total momentum remains constant.</p>
<p>The numbers on the balls indicate their masses; the numbers under the arrows are their speeds.</p>
<p>Drag the red slider backward to increase the speed of the red ball. When the velocity is correct, press the Launch button to start the balls moving.</p>
<p>Click the Again button for the next set of numbers.</p>
