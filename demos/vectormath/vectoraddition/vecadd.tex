\def\hpi{{\pi\over 2}}
\begin{document}
Let $v_n$ be the vector pointing at an angle $n\hpi$; that is,
$$v_n=(\cos n\hpi,\sin n\hpi)$$
Suppose we have two vectors, $v_m$ and $v_n$.  Their average is 
$$\bar v = \frc2(v_m+v_n) = \frc2(\cos m\hpi+\cos n\hpi, \sin m\hpi + \sin n\hpi)$$
The angle of this vector is
$$\tan^{-1}{\sin m\hpi+\sin n\hpi\over \cos m\hpi+\cos m\hpi}$$
I'm going to do an exhaustive listing of these:
