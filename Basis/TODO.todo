* Add a help dialog box which explains the different ways to write a unit vector.
* If you get it wrong, explain what happened? Maybe highlight the direction on the compass rose?
* Make the compass rose in all four directions, perhaps? Or leave room for the negatives so I can pulse them on a wrong answer.
* Add an option to go back and forth between uvmode=0 and uvmode=1 (that is, xy or ij)
