* Check the math; something is wrong here.
* When you press reset, a couple things need to happen:
** First, change the velocities to something round and sensible, don't just keep the values.
** Second, clear out the KE bars.
* Show the momentum and kinetic energy before and after the collision, with the math worked out.
** The momentum could have the arrows set up as an addition problem
